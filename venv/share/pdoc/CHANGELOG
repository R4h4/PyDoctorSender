0.3.1
=====
  - Source code is extracted from __wrapped__ if it exists, and then
    falls back to inspect.getsourcelines. This reverses the behavior
    implemented in #6.
  - Fix Python 2.6 compatibility by requiring Markdown < 2.5 (#19).
    Markdown 2.5 dropped support for Python 2.6.
  - Get rid of tabs that sneaked in from #17.
  - Fix pep8 violations.

0.3.0
=====
  - Major HTML face lift. Kudos to @knadh!
    (PR: https://github.com/BurntSushi/pdoc/pull/17)

0.2.4
=====
  - Fixed bug in HTTP server that was referencing a non-existent
    variable.

0.2.3
=====
  - Fixed #10 (the --template-dir flag now works).

0.2.2
=====
  - Fixes #7 by ignoring module loaders that lack a 'path' attribute.

0.2.1
=====
  - Fixes #5 by trying to find source for decorated functions.

0.2.0
=====
  - Fix issue #2 by making pdoc a package instead of a module.
    The templates are now included as package_data, which seems
    to be more portable (its final location is more predictable).

0.1.8
=====
  - pdoc now interprets `__pdoc__[key] = None` as an explicit way
    to hide `key` from the public interface of its module.

0.1.7
=====
  - Removed __new__ from the public interface. I think __init__
    is sufficient.

0.1.6
=====
  - Fixed bug #1.

0.1.5
=====
  - Fixed a bug with an improper use of getattr.
  - Made pdoc aware of __slots__. (Every identifier in __slots__
    is automatically interpreted as an instance variable.)

0.1.4
=====
  - Fixed bug where getargspec wasn't being used in Python 2.x.

0.1.3
=====
  - Avoid a FQDN lookup.

0.1.2
=====
  - A few doco touchups.
  - Fixed a bug in Py3K. Use getfullargspec when available.

0.1.1
=====
  - Documentation touch ups.
  - Removed unused command line flags.

0.1.0
=====
First public release.
